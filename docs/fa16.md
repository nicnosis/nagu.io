## Nicolas Aguirre - Summary of Teaching, Fall 2016
### Summary
As a whole, my first semester teaching was successful. I began the semester saddled with anxiety and doubt, and ended feeling confident and enriched by the experience. The demands of my coursework and needs of my students have pushed me to deliver my best work yet. Getting to know my colleagues and interacting with them has been a joy; I find myself quickly adapting to my new environment. I have positive expectations about this upcoming semester. The future seems to hold promises of rewarding experiences.

### Courses
#### MSCH-J360: Web Design
This is a challenging course to teach. Web design is an expansive topic, and its software ecosystem is constantly evolving. I made an effort to familiarize students with new and emerging technologies, and designed the course to be project-oriented. Students finish the course having completed five projects that test knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Students seemed to respond positively to the use of _p5.js_, a visualization library designed for non-coders. This is sensible as many of them are journalism students and probably visual learners.

#### MSCH-J362: Multimedia Storytelling
This course was somewhat out of my comfort zone, but I made an effort to capitalize on my creative strengths and bring those to the classroom. About half of the coursework was based on work with Adobe Illustrator, with a focus on visual design concepts such as color theory, proportion and page layout.

I intended to teach elementary data visualization using Tableau, but ran into some technical problems. Lab computers had Tableau Public _(free version)_ installed, but were not able to establish connectivity with the Tableau server. As a result, students could not save their visualizations. I did my best to improvise, and instead opted for students to complete a written assignment in which they analyzed one of several visualizations I provided.

The last assignment involved students grouping up to create a non-linear story using a program called [Twine](http://twinery.org). This was a great success. Students seemed to communicate and work well in small groups, they were enthusiastic about their stories, and as a whole they seemed much less inhibited towards the end of the class.
